# Oasis

Oasis is a fully open-source, mostly 3d-printed smart terrarium.

{{< video src="docs/video.mp4" width=100% controls="yes" autoplay="true" >}}

Features include:

- [high-power LED lighting](/docs/random_notes/#light-intensity)
- a built-in water tank and mister to provide plants with water and maintain high humidity
- fans for airflow
- a temperature+humidity sensor for monitoring environment conditions
- wifi connectivity to allow control and configuration from your phone or computer (see [web interface](/docs/usage_guide/#web-interface))
- outer dimensions: ~8" diameter and ~13" tall

This project is fully open-source, meaning that the designs for the 3d printed parts, electronics schematics, and software are available to download and modify. Find them on GitHub: https://github.com/justbuchanan/oasis.

This website contains a detailed [build guide](/docs/build_guide), bill of materials, and other notes on the project.

Most of this project is accessible to the average DIYer with access to a 3d printer, however the electronics portion of the project is a bit more involved. See the [Electronics page](/docs/electronics) for more details.
