## wire holes too small

I made my own footprint for soldering power wires to the board that included two holes for strain releif. The wires don't fit through the holes... need to make them a bit bigger.

## bigger/cleaner traces

Not really an error, but future versions should use larger traces between LEDs and also cleaner shaping/traces.

## Mounting holes no longer needed

Mounting method changed, so we don't need the holes.
